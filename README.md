# kinematic_analysis
Kinematic analysis of data from OpenSim .sto files. Extracts distance covered, 'player load' and external mechanical work from points .
within trials.

How the package works:

config.py - where you set the variables needed to run the package.

full_body_kinematics.py - creates a pandas dataframe for the trial of interest using the associated position and velocity .sto files. Acceleration and energies are calculated resulting in the following dataframe set up:



player_load.py - 

distance_covered.py - 

external_mechanical_work.py - 

point_dict_creator.py - 

heart_rate.py - 

write_results.py -

visualise_data.py -
